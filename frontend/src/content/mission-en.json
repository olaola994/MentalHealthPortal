This harmony allows us to stay close to our clients at every stage of their journey. We consider our service a unique place on the Polish internet because it brings together specialists from many areas such as psychology, psychotherapy, and coaching, but it also includes space for natural therapies. From the beginning, this was something more for us than just a mental health support center. The roots of our service lie in our own practice and work with Clients and Patients. We are psychologists, psychotherapists, and coaches ourselves, and in our individual work, we work remotely with our Clients. Each of us also has a beautiful story of encountering life’s challenges. We know what 'it' feels like. We work within a team of remarkable individuals, constantly striving to improve and exchange experiences to enhance the quality of our work daily. We aim to provide you with exactly the support you need to live in harmony with yourself.",

        "text": "According to research, one in four Poles experiences or will experience mental health disorders. Statistics indicate that 7.5 million Poles regularly suffer from mental health issues and disorders. The current state of care and support was highlighted by a 2019 NIK (Supreme Audit Office) review (before the pandemic), showing that nearly one in ten Poles lacks access to mental health care. There are still areas on Poland's map where residents have no access to mental health services. This situation worsened during the pandemic, as mental health specialists worldwide faced an influx of new Clients and Patients. This picture is completed by the ongoing societal taboo surrounding mental health disorders and related issues.\n\nAt Mentivita, we tackle these challenges head-on. Our goal is to increase access to mental health care, break the taboo of using such services, and provide a safe space for credible help. We achieve this through secure and technologically accessible formats and a professional team of specialists. We understand how crucial regular care for our well-being and mental health is – especially in today’s world.",

We understand this because we’ve been there, and that’s why we can understand you.
